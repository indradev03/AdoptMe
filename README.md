So, this the pet management system 


Pet Shop Management System is a web application where the purchase and sale of pets, pet products, and accessories, took place. Today we came to know about the circumstances that most of the people depends on Local markets and nearby houses to buy a pet for their house. Through this project we are planning to digitalize this process by online marketing. Thus, the individuals can also rely on other persons across the district to buy variety breeds of pets. People could also be able to come to know about the different price ranges for the same breed offered by different persons or shops. The users can view various pets up for sale and can add to cart and checkout. Admin can manage the orders and the pets and suppliers. It has many functionalities such as admin panel for management of pets and categories and orders and cart functionalities.

 Our project also includes a special feature for buying street dogs through the app whereas its maintenance and operation are carried out by different non-government organizations through a website. This software has a very user-friendly interface. Thus, they will feel very easy to work on it. The software provides accuracy along with pleasant interface.
